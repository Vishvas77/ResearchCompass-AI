# 📖 Overview

ResearchCompass AI is an intelligent academic research assistant designed to simplify the process of discovering faculty members, exploring research domains, and identifying collaboration opportunities.

Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), semantic vector search, and live academic search, the system delivers personalized recommendations based on user interests while automating research assistance tasks through a LangGraph workflow.

The application currently runs through a command-line interface and demonstrates how modern LLM-powered agents can support students and researchers in academic environments.
